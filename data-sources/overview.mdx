    subgraph IncidentFox
    A[K8s Agent]
    B[AWS Agent]
    C[Metrics Agent]
    D[Coding Agent]
    E[Investigation Agent]
    end
    A --> F[Kubernetes Cluster]
    A --> G[Docker]
    B --> H[AWS CloudWatch/EC2/RDS]
    C --> I[Prometheus/Grafana/Datadog]
    C --> J[Sentry/New Relic]
    D --> K[GitHub/GitLab]
    E --> L[Elasticsearch/Splunk]
    E --> M[Snowflake/PostgreSQL/BigQuery]
```

## Credential Management

All credentials should be stored securely using vault references:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "coralogix": {
      "api_key": "vault://secrets/coralogix-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Never store credentials in plain text in configuration files.
</Warning>

### Vault Reference Format

```
vault://path/to/secret
```

IncidentFox supports:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- Environment variables (for development)

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Data Sources">
    Identify which platforms you want IncidentFox to access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create API Keys">
    Generate read-only API keys for each platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store in Vault">
    Add credentials to your secrets manager
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure in Web UI">
    Add data source configuration in Team Console
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Verify IncidentFox can access each data source
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required Permissions

Each data source requires specific permissions. Generally, IncidentFox needs **read-only** access for investigation.

| Data Source | Required Permissions |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Coralogix | API key with read access |
| AWS | CloudWatch read, EC2 describe, RDS read, Lambda read |
| Kubernetes | Pod logs, events, describe resources |
| GitHub | Repo read, issues read, PRs read |
| Snowflake | SELECT on relevant tables |
| Datadog | API key + App key with read access |
| Prometheus | Query access to /api/v1/query endpoint |
| Grafana | Viewer role, API key with read access |
| Sentry | Project read, issue read |
| Elasticsearch | Read access to indices |
| PostgreSQL | SELECT on relevant tables |
| Docker | Docker socket access or API access |

<Tip>
**Principle of least privilege**: Only grant permissions that are necessary for investigation. IncidentFox doesn't need write access unless you enable auto-remediation.
</Tip>

## Data Flow

When IncidentFox investigates an incident:

1. **Agent determines** which data sources are relevant
2. **Tools are invoked** to query each data source
3. **Data is retrieved** and processed locally
4. **Results are correlated** across sources
5. **Findings are reported** back to the user

Data is:
- Retrieved on-demand (not continuously polled)
- Processed in-memory (not stored long-term)
- Filtered by time range (typically last 1-24 hours)
