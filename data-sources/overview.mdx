## Overview

IncidentFox connects to your existing observability and data platforms to investigate incidents. This section covers how to configure each data source.

## Supported Data Sources

| [Datadog](/data-sources/datadog) | Supported | Metrics, logs, APM traces |
| [Grafana](/data-sources/grafana) | Supported | Prometheus queries, dashboards, alerts |
| New Relic | Supported | NRQL queries, APM summary |
| Elasticsearch | Supported | Log search, aggregations |

### Cloud Providers

| [AWS](/data-sources/aws) | Supported | CloudWatch, EC2, Lambda, RDS, ECS, CodePipeline |
| GCP | Roadmap | Cloud Logging, GKE, Cloud Run |
| Azure | Roadmap | Monitor, AKS, Functions |

### Infrastructure

## Data Source Architecture

```mermaid

    subgraph IncidentFox
    A[K8s Agent]
    B[AWS Agent]
    C[Metrics Agent]
    D[Coding Agent]
    end
    A --> E[Kubernetes Cluster]
    B --> F[AWS CloudWatch]
    C --> G[Coralogix/Datadog/Grafana]
    D --> H[GitHub Repos]
    G --> I[Snowflake<br/>enrich]
```

## Credential Management

All credentials should be stored securely using vault references:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "coralogix": {
      "api_key": "vault://secrets/coralogix-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Never store credentials in plain text in configuration files.
</Warning>

### Vault Reference Format

```
vault://path/to/secret
```

IncidentFox supports:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- Environment variables (for development)

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Data Sources">
    Identify which platforms you want IncidentFox to access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create API Keys">
    Generate read-only API keys for each platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store in Vault">
    Add credentials to your secrets manager
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure in Web UI">
    Add data source configuration in Team Console
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Verify IncidentFox can access each data source
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required Permissions

Each data source requires specific permissions. Generally, IncidentFox needs **read-only** access for investigation.

| Data Source | Required Permissions |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Coralogix | API key with read access |
| AWS | CloudWatch read, EC2 describe, RDS read |
| Kubernetes | Pod logs, events, describe resources |
| GitHub | Repo read, issues read, PRs read |
| Snowflake | SELECT on relevant tables |
| Datadog | API key + App key with read access |

<Tip>
**Principle of least privilege**: Only grant permissions that are necessary for investigation. IncidentFox doesn't need write access unless you enable auto-remediation.
</Tip>

## Data Flow

When IncidentFox investigates an incident:

1. **Agent determines** which data sources are relevant
2. **Tools are invoked** to query each data source
3. **Data is retrieved** and processed locally
4. **Results are correlated** across sources
5. **Findings are reported** back to the user

Data is:
- Retrieved on-demand (not continuously polled)
- Processed in-memory (not stored long-term)
- Filtered by time range (typically last 1-24 hours)
