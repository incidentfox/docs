## Overview

IncidentFox integrates with Sentry for error tracking, issue analysis, and release correlation. This helps identify application errors that may be causing incidents.

## Tools Available

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sentry_list_issues` | List issues in a project |
| `sentry_get_issue_details` | Get detailed information about an issue |
| `sentry_list_projects` | List all Sentry projects |
| `sentry_get_project_stats` | Get error statistics for a project |
| `sentry_list_releases` | List releases and deployment info |

## Configuration

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "sentry": {
      "enabled": true,
      "organization": "your-org-slug",
      "auth_token": "vault://secrets/sentry-token"
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

Create a Sentry API token with the following scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `project:read` | List and view projects |
| `event:read` | View issue details and events |
| `org:read` | View organization info |

## Example Queries

### Find Recent Errors

```
@incidentfox what errors are occurring in the checkout service?
```

### Correlate with Deployment

```
@incidentfox did the latest release introduce any new errors?
```

### Get Issue Details

```
@incidentfox show me details about Sentry issue PROJ-1234
```

## Use Cases

### Error Spike Investigation

When investigating latency or availability issues:

1. IncidentFox checks Sentry for recent error spikes
2. Correlates error timing with incident timeline
3. Identifies specific exceptions causing problems

### Release Impact Analysis

After a deployment:

1. Compare error rates before/after release
2. Identify new error types introduced
3. Correlate with GitHub commits in the release

### Root Cause Identification

Sentry provides stack traces that help identify:

- Specific code paths causing errors
- Environment differences (e.g., specific hosts)
- User impact scope

## Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `organization` | Sentry organization slug | Required |
| `auth_token` | API authentication token | Required |
| `default_project` | Default project for queries | Optional |
| `environment` | Filter to specific environment | Optional |

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting

Sentry has API rate limits. If you hit them:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "sentry": {
      "rate_limit_retry": true,
      "max_retries": 3
    }
  }
}
```

### Missing Events

If recent events aren't appearing:

1. Check Sentry data retention settings
2. Verify the project has events
3. Ensure the time range is correct
