## Overview

The Slack bot is the primary interface for triggering IncidentFox investigations. Mention the bot in any channel to start an investigation.

## Prerequisites

- Slack workspace admin access
- IncidentFox account with Slack integration enabled

## Setup

### Step 1: Install the App

Your IncidentFox admin will provide an installation link:

```
https://app.incidentfox.ai/integrations/slack/install
```

Click the link and authorize the app for your workspace.

### Step 2: Configure Required Permissions

The app requests these permissions:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `chat:write` | Post investigation results |
| `app_mentions:read` | Detect @incidentfox mentions |
| `channels:history` | Read context from channel |
| `groups:history` | Read context from private channels |
| `im:history` | Read direct message context |
| `reactions:write` | React to acknowledge messages |

### Step 3: Invite to Channels

Invite the bot to channels where you want to use it:

```
/invite @incidentfox
```

<Tip>
Add the bot to your incident channels so it's ready when you need it.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Test the Connection

Send a test message:

```
@incidentfox hello
```

The bot should respond with a confirmation.

## Usage

### Basic Investigation

```
@incidentfox investigate high latency in the payments service
```

### Check Specific Resources

```
@incidentfox check the status of cart pods in production namespace
```

### Query Logs

```
@incidentfox search for errors in checkout service logs from the last hour
```

### Get Help

```
@incidentfox help
```

## Response Format

When you trigger an investigation, IncidentFox:

1. Reacts with emoji to acknowledge
2. Creates a thread for the response
3. Posts structured findings:
   - Summary
   - Root cause
   - Evidence
   - Timeline
   - Recommendations

### Example Response

```
Investigation: High latency in payments service

Summary: Payment service experiencing elevated latency due to
database connection pool exhaustion.

Root Cause:
• Description: RDS connection pool at maximum capacity
• Confidence: 92%
• Evidence:
  - CloudWatch RDS connections at 100%
  - Application logs show "connection timeout"
  - Spike correlates with deploy at 14:32

Timeline:
• 14:32 - New deployment rolled out
• 14:35 - Connection count started increasing
• 14:42 - Connection pool exhausted

Recommendations:
1. Increase max_connections parameter
2. Review application pool settings
3. Consider rollback if issue persists
```

## Configuring Data Sources

Once the IncidentFox bot is installed, team members can configure data source integrations directly from Slack.

### Opening the Configuration Panel

There are two ways to access the configuration panel:

**Option 1: Welcome Message**

When IncidentFox joins a new channel, it posts a welcome message with a **Configure** button. Click this button to open the configuration panel.

**Option 2: App Home**

1. Click on the IncidentFox bot's avatar in any channel
2. Click **Open App**
3. You'll see:
   - **Connected Integrations** - Data sources already configured (click **Edit** to modify)
   - **Available Integrations** - Data sources you can add (click **Connect** to set up)

### Configuration Modal

When you click **Connect** or **Edit** for any integration, a modal appears with:

1. **Video Walkthrough** - Step-by-step guide for setting up the integration
2. **Setup Instructions** - Quick reference for creating API keys
3. **Configuration Fields** - API key, domain, and integration-specific settings
4. **Custom Context (Optional)** - Additional context to help the AI understand your setup

<Note>
Credentials are encrypted and stored securely. You can revoke access at any time by deleting the integration.
</Note>

See individual data source pages for specific setup instructions:
- [Coralogix](/data-sources/coralogix) - Log search, metrics, and alerts
- [Datadog](/data-sources/datadog) - Metrics, logs, and APM
- [AWS](/data-sources/aws) - CloudWatch and infrastructure

## Configuration

### Default Slack Channel

Set a default channel for notifications:

```json
{
  "slack_channel": "#incidents",
  "slack_group_to_ping": "@oncall-platform"
}
```

### Bot Response Style

Configure in agent prompts how the bot communicates:

```
## Slack Communication Style
- Be concise and actionable
- Use bullet points for multiple items
- Include confidence levels
- Link to dashboards when relevant
- Use thread replies for detailed info
```

## Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@incidentfox investigate <issue>` | Full investigation |
| `@incidentfox check <resource>` | Quick status check |
| `@incidentfox logs <service>` | Fetch recent logs |
| `@incidentfox metrics <service>` | Query metrics |
| `@incidentfox help` | Show available commands |
| `@incidentfox status` | Check agent status |

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding

1. Verify bot is invited to the channel
2. Check bot is online in Slack
3. Ensure mention includes `@incidentfox`

### Permission Errors

1. Re-authorize the app
2. Check channel permissions
3. Verify bot token is valid

### Slow Responses

1. Complex investigations take 30-60 seconds
2. Check data source connectivity
3. Review configured timeout settings

## Best Practices

1. **Use dedicated channels** for incidents
2. **Include context** in your request
3. **Use threads** to keep conversations organized
4. **React to helpful responses** to improve the model
5. **Share dashboards** the bot references
