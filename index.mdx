## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dual-Runtime Agent Architecture">
    IncidentFox uses two powerful agent runtimes:
    - **OpenAI SDK Agent** - Production automation with multi-agent orchestration (Planner + Specialists)
    - **Claude SDK SRE Agent** - Interactive debugging with Kubernetes sandbox isolation

    Specialized agents include K8s, AWS, Metrics, Coding, and Investigation agents working together.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="300+ Built-in Tools">
    Pre-built integrations across 20+ categories:
    - **Kubernetes**: Pod logs, events, deployments, resource usage (9 tools)
    - **AWS**: EC2, Lambda, RDS, ECS, CloudWatch (8+ tools)
    - **Observability**: Grafana, Datadog, Prometheus, Coralogix, Sentry, New Relic (15+ tools)
    - **Log Analysis**: Statistics, sampling, pattern search, anomaly detection (7 tools)
    - **Docker**: Container logs, stats, exec, events (15 tools)
    - **GitHub**: Code search, PRs, issues, Actions, commits (16 tools)

## What Can IncidentFox Do?

### Incident Investigation

When an incident occurs, IncidentFox automatically:

1. **Gathers Context** - Pulls logs, metrics, and recent changes from your observability stack
2. **Analyzes Root Cause** - Correlates data across services to identify the issue
3. **Provides Timeline** - Reconstructs what happened and when
4. **Suggests Fixes** - Recommends actionable remediation steps

```
@incidentfox investigate why the payments service is slow
```

### CI/CD Auto-Fix

When your CI pipeline fails, IncidentFox can:

1. **Detect Failures** - Monitors GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, and other CI systems
2. **Analyze Logs** - Reads test output and build errors
3. **Identify Root Cause** - Correlates failures with code changes in the PR
4. **Propose Fixes** - Suggests code changes to resolve the issue

### Proactive Monitoring

IncidentFox can monitor your systems and alert before issues escalate:

- **Anomaly Detection** - Prophet-based forecasting identifies unusual patterns
- **Correlation Analysis** - Links metrics across services to find relationships
- **Knowledge Base** - RAPTOR hierarchical retrieval learns from runbooks and past incidents
- **Alert Correlation** - Connects Prometheus, Alertmanager, and PagerDuty alerts
