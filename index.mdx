## What Can IncidentFox Do?

### Incident Investigation

When an incident occurs, IncidentFox automatically:

1. **Gathers Context** - Pulls logs, metrics, and recent changes from your observability stack
2. **Analyzes Root Cause** - Correlates data across services to identify the issue
3. **Provides Timeline** - Reconstructs what happened and when
4. **Suggests Fixes** - Recommends actionable remediation steps

```
@incidentfox investigate why the payments service is slow
```

### CI/CD Auto-Fix

When your CI pipeline fails, IncidentFox can:

1. **Detect Failures** - Monitors GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, and other CI systems
2. **Analyze Logs** - Reads test output and build errors
3. **Identify Root Cause** - Correlates failures with code changes in the PR
4. **Propose Fixes** - Suggests code changes to resolve the issue

### Proactive Monitoring

IncidentFox can monitor your systems and alert before issues escalate:

- **Anomaly Detection** - Prophet-based forecasting identifies unusual patterns
- **Correlation Analysis** - Links metrics across services to find relationships
- **Knowledge Base** - Learns from your runbooks and past incidents
